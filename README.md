# MachineLearningPython
Machine Learning Models pre-trained and trained in Python.

Tensorflow, Matplotlib, ImageAI, OpenCV, Pytorch, Keras in collaboration with my own Modeltemplates(Part of JasAI) have been used.

I recommend creating a virtual environment in Anaconda installing all dependencies to access my code.
Required libraries are mentioned in each project!
